    "**实验目标：**\n",
    "\n",
    "通过本实验，你将深入了解和实践说话人识别技术，并掌握利用声音特征进行有效说话人识别的基本方法，了解不同特征和模型对识别准确率的影响。\n",
    "\n",
    "实验的核心目标是使用TIMIT数据集来训练一个说话人识别系统，涵盖数据预处理、特征提取、模型训练和评估等关键步骤。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**实验方法：**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. 数据预处理和划分(可选)：**\n",
    "  - 数据集下载地址（4月17日前有效）：https://f.ws59.cn/f/du8yd2536vl\n",
    "  - 为了方便大家，我们提供了划分好的TIMIT数据集结构，当然你也可以根据需求自行划分该数据集。\n",
    "  - 为简化难度，我们排除了SA的两个方言句子，并在剩余的8个句子中选取了SX的5个句子和SI的1个句子作为训练集，SI的另外2个句子作为测试集。\n",
    "  - 该链接下载的数据集只保留了音频文件，完整数据集（包含音频对应文本、标注等信息）可参见备注链接下载。\n",
    "  \n",
    "**2. 特征提取：**\n",
    "  - 学习并实现包括但不限于MFCC特征等特征的提取，探索声音信号的频率和时间特性。\n",
    "  - 鼓励尝试和比较其他特征提取方法，例如LPCC或声谱图特征，以理解不同特征对识别性能的影响。\n",
    "  \n",
    "**3. 模型选择和训练：**\n",
    "  - 探索并选择适合的分类器和模型进行说话人识别，如GMM、Softmax分类器或深度学习模型。\n",
    "  - 实现模型训练流程，使用训练集数据训练模型。\n",
    "  \n",
    "**4. 评估和分析：**\n",
    "  - 使用准确率作为主要的评价指标在测试集上评估模型性能。\n",
    "  - 对比不同特征和模型的性能，分析其对说话人识别准确率的影响。\n",
    "  - 可视化不同模型的识别结果和错误率，讨论可能的改进方法。\n",
    "\n",
    "**实验要求：**\n",
    "  - 1.选择并实现至少一种特征的提取，并鼓励尝试其他特征提取方法。\n",
    "  - 2.选择并实现至少一种分类器或模型进行说话人识别，并使用准确率评估指标评估其性能。\n",
    "  - 3.通过实验对比、分析和可视化，撰写详细的实验报告，包括实验目的、实验方法、结果分析和结论。\n",
    "  - 4.实验报告应以清晰、逻辑性强的形式呈现，图表和结果应清楚明了。\n",
    "\n",
    "**其他说明：**\n",
    "  - 实验的最终打分环节会看识别性能，会对原理和实现代码部分做抽查提问，综合评定成绩。\n",
    "  - 我们**鼓励做原创性探索**，即使性能不是很好，但有创新性、有价值、有意义的探索和尝试会有额外加分。\n",
